-- Manufacturing Failure Analytics
-- Data source: production and maintenance logs (SQLite)

-- Data preparation steps:
-- 1. Cleaning invalid or incomplete failure records
-- 2. Aggregating production volume by product type
-- 3. Aggregating failure events by failure category
-- 4. Joining production and failure data
-- 5. Preparing normalized failure rate calculations

-- Note:
-- SQL was used for analytical data preparation.
-- Final modeling, calculations, and visual logic
-- were implemented in Power BI using DAX.
